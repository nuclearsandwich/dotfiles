# nuclearsandwich's Dotfiles and Configs #

## WARNING! ##
THESE FILES ARE NOT YET FIT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION.
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

## Description ##
This contains all my dotfiles for various things.
Notable are my Xdefaults, gitconfig, and hgconfig.
They are nice but not my original creations. In fact they are mostly
pinched from Tim Pope and Steve Losh.
